# 🧠 Global Mental Health Disorder Prediction – Project Template

This document outlines the full project template including phases, tasks, modules and deliverables to guide development from start to finish.

---

## ✅ Project Phases

### Phase 1: 💡 Problem Definition
- [ ] Define the core research question
- [ ] Identify outcome variable (target: mental disorder likelihood)
- [ ] Set project goals (policy insight, risk prediction, dashboard)

---

### Phase 2: 📥 Data Collection
- [ ] Identify relevant datasets (WHO, CDC, GBD, Reddit, etc.)
- [ ] Download and catalog datasets
- [ ] Document data sources and licenses

---

### Phase 3: 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- [ ] Merge and align datasets
- [ ] Handle missing values and outliers
- [ ] Encode categorical variables
- [ ] Normalize or scale numerical features
- [ ] Save processed data to `data/processed/`

---

### Phase 4: 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Plot distribution of mental health metrics
- [ ] Identify global/regional disparities
- [ ] Correlate mental health with socioeconomic indicators
- [ ] Document findings in `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb`

---

### Phase 5: 🧠 Modeling
- [ ] Select baseline models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- [ ] Train/test split or cross-validation
- [ ] Evaluate performance (ROC-AUC, accuracy, F1-score)
- [ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Save final model in `models/`

---

### Phase 6: 📈 Visualization & Reporting
- [ ] Create visuals: heatmaps, bar charts, maps
- [ ] Summarize key insights from model
- [ ] Write report and export to PDF (`reports/final_report.pdf`)
- [ ] Prepare presentation or dashboard (Streamlit/PowerPoint)

---

### Phase 7: 🚀 (Optional) Deployment
- [ ] Build web app using Streamlit or Flask
- [ ] Allow input of demographic data to predict risk
- [ ] Host locally or on Render/Heroku
- [ ] Create `app.py` and `requirements.txt`
